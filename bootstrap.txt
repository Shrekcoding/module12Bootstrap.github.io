For this assignment, I have made seven websites. 

For the home page, I made a drop down navigation using the navbar collapse class that bootstrap has provided and putting my links in an unordered list. 

Buttons.html contains multiple colored buttons that correspond to the websites they took you to. For instance, the Youtube button is red to mach the company's color scheme.

Carousel.Html contains pictures of art projects I have done this year. I made indicators as well as left and right controls so that one could easily scroll throug the collection.

For forms.html, I created a simple email form that does nothing. However, the form will detect an invalid email if one were to be entered.

I centered the Modal in modal.html and made it so that one could open and close the modal using target and dismiss properties on two buttons.

For the Rows and collumns html page, I made a row containing some collumns with differing size values.

On ShowCollapse.html, I made it so that viewers could open and close a collumn using the row collapse class.

In addiction to bootstrap css and js, I linked my own minor css page to all my html pages. The page simply turns the background gray and centers wording along with some divs.
